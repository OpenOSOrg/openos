    "## Shell\n",
    "The shell is a basic interface that allows users to communicate with the kernel and any installed programs. Whenever you open a terminal, the kernel starts an instance of a shell program, or shell \"session\". When most people interact with computers, they do so through graphical user interfaces that they navigate using a mouse or their finger. The shell is completely text-based and designed for programmers. It has its own programming language of special commands to access kernel functionalities. For more information about terminals and shells, please refer to the relevant sections of [the following textbook](https://jappavoo.github.io/UndertheCovers/textbook/unix/intro.html#operating-systems-and-unix).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will introduce several shell commands that you will see and use very frequently. We encourage you to experiment with all of the commands and examples covered in this section! It is by far the best way to become comfortable with the shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some basic shell commands\n",
    "#### Help and information\n",
    "##### `man <command>`\n",
    "This is probably the most important command for students new to Linux and interacting with computers via the shell. The `man` command (short for \"manual\") allows you to access documentation about all programs installed on a system. For example, to view documentation for the `man` command itself, you simply type `man man` to open its man page. You can scroll through man pages using the arrow keys or `ctrl+f` (move forward one page) and `ctrl+b` (move backward one page) and exit back to the command line by typing `q`. For more information about any of the other commands discussed in this chapter (or any chapter for that matter), consult these **man pages**!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navigating your system via the command line \n",
    "The shell provides us with a way to navigate through our machine's file directory. When you open a new terminal in the development environment, you will be in your **home directory**. The directory that you are in at any given time is called the **working directory**. To see what your current working directory is, simply type `pwd` into the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pwd \n",
    "/home/username \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to reference files and directories in the shell. The first is using **absolute paths**. When referring to directories this way, you have to write the entire path to the desired directory starting at the root `/`. The advantage to this approach is that these references remain static no matter where you are in the system. As long as you don't move a file, it's absolute path remains the same. To change your working directory, you can use the `cd` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd /home\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command does not print anything to the command line, but if you rerun `pwd` you will see that the working directory has changed!\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option for referencing files is to use **relative paths**. They are called relative paths because they are written *relative* to your current working directory. Thus, the path to the file of interest depends on your working directory. The advantage to using relative paths is that they are generally much shorter than absolute paths. In addition, there are some nice shortcuts you can use if you aren't trying to move too far away from your current working directory. For example, if I want to move to the parent directory of my working directory, I can simply type `cd ..` instead of writing out the whole path of the parent directory. When moving into the child directory of the current working directory, you can just type `cd child` or `cd child/grandchild` and the shell will know that you are using a relative path since it does not start with a `/`. Typing `cd child` is equivalent to typing `cd ./child`, since `.` is used to denote the current working directory. You can also get to the \"grandparent\" directory by typing `cd ../..` or one of your parent directory's other children using the command `cd ../sibling`. To go to your home directory, you can type `cd ~`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to view the contents of a directory. You can do this using the `ls` command. If you provide it with no arguments, it will simply print the contents of your working directory. \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "file1.txt file2.txt hw1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The directories will be differentiated from the plain files in the development environment with bold colored text. You can also provide an absolute or relative path as an argument to the `ls` command (e.g., `ls /path/to/directory/`) to see the contents of a different directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Recap:\n",
    "* All file paths start at the root directory `/` and you can reference them absolutely or using relative paths\n",
    "* Your home directory is `~`, the current working directory is `.`, and the parent of the working directory is `..`\n",
    "* `pwd`: prints your working directory\n",
    "* `cd /some/directory`: move to the specified directory\n",
    "* `ls /some/directory`: print the files and directories within the chosen directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating, viewing, and manipulating files and directories\n",
    "* `touch <desiredfilename>`: create a new file. \n",
    "* `cat <filename>`: print contents of a file to the terminal.\n",
    "* `mv /path/to/<filename> /desired/path/to/file/`: move a file to a different directory. To move a directory instead of just a single file, use the flag `-r`. \n",
    "* `cp <filename> <filecopyname>`: make a copy of an existing file. \n",
    "* `mdkir <desireddirectoryname>`: create a new directory. \n",
    "* `emacs <filename>`: open the file \"filename\" in the EMACS editor. More on this in the following section.\n",
    "* `wc <filename>`: print newline, word, and byte counts for a file. To see just the word count, add the flag `-w`.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous\n",
    "##### `echo`\n",
    "Display a line of text to standard out. \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ echo \"Hello world\"\n",
    "Hello world\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### `ctrl+c`\n",
    "This will terminate whatever process/command is currently running in the shell. Great if you think your code may be stuck in an infinite loop or is just taking much longer than you thought it would to finish running. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### `ctrl+l`\n",
    "This will clear your terminal and move the prompt up to the top of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symbols\n",
    "##### |\n",
    "This is known as the \"pipe\" symbol and is used to redirect the output of one command into the input of a second command. For example, if I type `ls .. | wc -w`, the total number of files/directories in the `..` directory will be printed to the command line. \n",
    "##### >\n",
    "This symbol is used to assign a redirect-out to a command. For example, if I type: `echo \"Hello world\" > hw.txt`, instead of printing \"Hello world\" to the terminal, the right carrot symbol would direct that output into the file \"hw.txt\". \n",
    "##### <\n",
    "This symbol is used to assign a redirect-in to a command. For example, we can type `cat < file.txt`. In this situation, this is equivalent to `cat file.txt`. \n",
    "##### &\n",
    "Typing the ampersand symbol & at the end of a command will result in that command being run in the background. This means that you will immediately see another prompt even if the command you run has not finished running. "

    "## Editors\n",
    "Terminal-based text editors allow us to write and edit files when we don't have access to a GUI (e.g., when we are SSHing into a remote computer). [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) and [EMACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) are most common. **We are requiring that students use EMACS for this course, and those who use VIM will be penalized.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### EMACS Basics\n",
    "EMACS is a slightly more familiar-looking text editor that is valued for its extensibility. It is extremely configurable with a lot of tools and packages available. \n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in EMACS, type `emacs <filename>`. Unlike in VIM, you will immediately be able to write in/edit thew file. Once you are finished editing, you type `ctrl+x` followed by `ctrl+c` to save and exit. It will prompt you to confirm that you want to save and quit. Typing `y` and then enter will return you to the terminal.\n",

    "## Makefiles\n",
    "Hopefully, you are familiar with the process of compiling c files into executables to be run. Usually, this looks something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```gcc filename.c -o filename```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would compile the c file \"filename.c\" into an executable called \"filename\", which we could then run by typing `./filename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems easy enough, but having to type out commands like this can quickly become quite cumbersome when we have many different commands we want to run on different combinations of files or a lot of flags we want to use. In these more complex situations, we can use `make`. Make automates running commands on files when they have changed and is commonly used in \"building\" programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use `make`, you must write a file called a `makefile` that describes the relationships between the files in your program and provides commands for updating each file. Usually for c programs, the executable file is updated from object files (`.o` files), which are in turn made by compiling source files (`.c` files). Once you have written your makefile, you can just run the shell command `make` and it will perform all necessary recompilations. `make` knows which files need to be updated based on the last-modification times of the files. You can also provide command line arguments to make to specify which files should be recompiled and how. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Makefile Basics\n",
    "A simple makefile consists of rules with the following syntax: \n",
    "```\n",
    "target ...: prerequisites ...\n",
    "    recipe\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The *target* is typically the name of a file that is generated by a program (e.g. an executable or object file). It can also be the name of an action to carry out, like \"clean\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The *prerequisite* is a file that is used as input to create the target. It will often be multiple files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *recipe* is an action that `make` carries out. A recipe may have more than one command. There must be a tab character at the beginning of each recipe line.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's break down each line and rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line, we specify the flags we want to use to compile C files by assigning a value to CFLAGS (more on implicit variables like CFLAGS [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html)). The `override` directive just makes sure you use the assignments in the makefile even if the variable has previously been set with a command argument. \n",
    "* `-Wall`: turns on many compiler warning flags\n",
    "* `-Werror`: turns warnings into compilation errors\n",
    "* `-std=gnu99`: set c version\n",
    "* `-O0`: sets optimization level to 0 (faster compilation, better for debugging)\n",
    "* `-g`: adds debugging symbols to executable\n",
    "* `$(CFLAGS)`: include default flags\n",
    "* `-I.`: specifies directory where header files can be found (in this example, the working directory `.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the CFLAGS definition, we see a rule for building the test programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have a rule for building the parser's object file, followed by rules to build two test programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below that, there is an additional line that you can edit to add additional test scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the rules in the makefile have phony targets. They are not names for files, rather just names for a recipe to be executed when an explicit request is made. Using a phony target helps avoid conflicts with files of the same name and improves performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *checkprogs* rule builds all of the test programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last rule is the *clean* rule, which will just remove all object files and test files from the directory. \n",

    "## GDB\n",
    "gdb is your best friend when it comes to debugging. It allows you to step through a program line by line, examine variable values and the contents of the stack, and much more. For a quick reference, we recommend [this guide](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/gdb-refcard.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "In order to use gdb, you will have to use the `-g` command line flag when compiling. This flag makes sure that the necessary debugging information is produced. \n",
    "```\n",
    "gcc -g -o main main.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will compile the program `main.c` into an executable named \"main\" with debugging information. \n",
    "\n",
    "To open the program in the debugger, you can type `gdb main`. To exit gdb, type `q` or `quit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gdb provides documentation, which you can access by typing the command `help`. This will provide a list of topics, and you can then get information about a specific topic or command by typing `help <topic>` or `help <command>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using gdb to debug\n",
    "One of the more useful things you can do in gdb is set **breakpoints** and observe the state of the process mid-execution. There are a couple of ways to set a breakpoint:\n",
    "* `break <function>`: sets a breakpoint at the beginning of `function`.\n",
    "* `break <linenumber>`: sets the breakpoint to the given line number in the source file. Execution will stop **before** that line has been executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code is in multiple files, you may have to specify a file name before the function name or line number, e.g. `break <filename>:<function>` or `break <filename>:<linenumber>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To delete the breakpoints you have set, you can type `delete`. You can also delete a specific breakpoint by typing `delete <number>`. To find out what number each breakpoint is, type `info breakpoints`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have set all your desired breakpoints, you need to run the program. To do this, simply type the command `run` into gdb. If the program takes command line arguments, you can provide them the same way as you would in the command line, except you say \"run\" instead of the program name. Your code will execute up to where you specified your first breakpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you reach your breakpoint, you will probably want to look at the contents of the stack or some variables to make sure that your program is executing as expected. To see the current value of a variable, you can simply type `print <variablename>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To continue running the program after stopping at a break time, you have several options. Typing `continue` will set the program running again until you hit another breakpoint or the process finishes. Typing `step` (or just `s`) will execute the current source line and stop execution before the next source line, If the line that is about to be executed is a function call, then `step` will step into that function. In contrast, moving through execution using the `next` will not \"step in\" to a called function. It will continue until the next source line in *the current function*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Review\n",
    "* `break`: use to set breakpoints\n",
    "* `run`: run the program in gdb\n",
    "* `delete`: delete breakpoints\n",
    "* `continue`: set the program running again after being stopped at a breakpoint\n",
    "* `step`: execute the current source line and stop again before the next source line\n",
    "* `next`: continue until the next source line in the current function\n",
    "* `list <linenumber>`: print out some lines from the source code around `linenumber`.\n",
