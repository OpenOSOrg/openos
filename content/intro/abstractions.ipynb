By introducing the idea of a special file object called a *pipe*, you could allow programs to be combined together to do much more powerful tasks.   The **|** symbol tells the shell to create a pipe that connects the output of one program to the input of the next program.  So, let's say we are trying to find all the programs on our computer that have anything to do with perl; the following command will: 1) list the contents of the `/usr/bin/` directory, 2) send the output of that listing to a `grep` program that searches for the word perl, and 3) send the output of that `grep` to a program that counts the number of lines of input received."

    "So, you should now understand the abstraction of a process as a virtual computer, with CPU state and virtual memory.  A process (parent) can create another process (child) by calling `fork` which causes the kernel to create a child with a duplicate of the CPU state and virtual memory of the parent.  The child, like children everywhere, can decide to be different from its parent by `exec` of a different program.  In that case the kernel looks at the program, and creates a new virtual address space by loading (potentially lazily as we will see) the text, initialized, and uninitialized  data segments of the program into memory.  You can now see how to implement the core part of any shell, reading from `stdin` the names of programs to execute, and creating new processes to execute those programs.  "

Recall that the shell process has file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 (`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`) pointing to a character special file that represents a terminal, meaning that its input comes from a user typing characters in the terminal, and its output is displayed in the terminal. Recall also that the open file table is copied to the child process on a `fork` and is unchanged by an `exec`, so the child process running the new program will also receive its input from, and send its output to, the same terminal. \n",

We can also redirect the standard error output, descriptor 2, to a file in a similar way. \n",

    "While this is great for the user who can now use the shell to run multiple programs concurrently, there is a problem.  If the child finishes, it will exit with its status, but it will become a zombie if the shell never waits for it.  After a while, the system will be filled with zombies and come to a grinding halt.  \n",

    "The way Unix deals with this is by sending a signal to a parent process when a child finishes.  A signal is, for a virtual computer, similar to what an interrupt is for a physical computer.  It tells it that some event happened on the outside world that it might want to know about.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a large number of signals the system can tell you about, and you can find out more about all of them with `man 7 signal`.  In this case, the shell should register a signal handler for the `SIGCHLD` signal using the `sigaction` system call. \n",

If there was previously a handler registered, the `oldact` tells the caller what the old action was. This allows the shell to `wait` for zombie children in the signal handler function when it receives notification that a child process has exited. \n"

    "This chapter has given you a whirlwind tour of some of the key abstractions of Unix. A process is a virtual computer, with its own virtual CPU and virtual memory.   You should know how to create a new process, and tell it to execute a program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of Unix is the idea that we can combine many programs together, using a shell, where the input and output of processes can be set up to be the terminal, files, or pipes.  You should have an idea now on some of the key system calls that enable a shell to do this.  Later chapters will discuss in much more detail the abstraction of a CPU and how it is scheduled, how memory management works and the system calls you can use to control it, and how file systems work and their system calls.
