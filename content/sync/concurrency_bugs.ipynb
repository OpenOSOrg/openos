    "\n",
    "Atomicity violations are related to data races, but they are not the same. A data race occurs when two or more threads have conflicting accesses to a shared variable without any synchronization, but in some cases this may be the programmer's intent (not a bug). For example, we used a flag variable in {numref}`listing:sync:check_spinlock_fairness` to force the child threads to wait until the parent had finished creating all the threads. An atomicity violation occurs when some section of code needs to be atomic for correctness, but there is no synchronzation to ensure atomicity. In {numref}`fig:sync:bugs:mysql_atomicity_violation` we show a real-world example of an atomicity violation bug found in one version of MySQL. Here, the atomicity violation bug is also a data race, since the conflicting accesses to `thd->proc_info` are not separated by any synchronization. Programmers often mistakenly believe that short code sequences can't be interrupted or interleaved, leading to atomicity violation bugs like the MySQL example. The solution is simple: introduce a lock to protect the `proc_info` and ensure the lock is acquired prior to checking if `thd->proc_info` is NULL, and released only after Thread 1 is done using `thd->proc_info`. (Thread 2 should also hold the lock when setting `thd->proc_info` to NULL.)\n",

Here, the programmer has ensured that all accesses to the shared data in the bank account are protected by a lock variable, however, they have not enforced the required atomicity. Because the lock is released after reading the old balance from the account, and re-acquired before writing the new balance, two threads can still interleave in a way that causes one of the deposits to be lost.\n",

In this example, Thread 1 is responsible for initialization and creation of other threads. Thread 2 is one of the threads created by Thread 1, and the programmers assumed that Thread 2 would have to run after Thread 1. Unfortunately, Thread 2 becomes runnable as soon as it is created, and may execute before Thread 1 assigns a value to the variable `mThread`. In the best case scenario, `mThread` will be NULL prior to the assignment in Thread 1, and Thread 2 will crash when it attempts to dereference `mThread->mState`. Why is this the best case? Because if `mThread` is non-NULL but not correctly initialized yet, then Thread 2 will set its `mState` from a random memory location and could continue to execute in unexpected ways for a long time without actually crashing. Crash failures are *much* easier to detect and debug than arbitrary incorrect behavior. \n",

    "### What is a resource? \n",
    "\n",
    "In discussing deadlocks, we often talk about *resources* that are shared by multiple threads or processes in a computer system. In general, a resource is any object that is needed by a thread to do its work. Some resources may be physical objects, like a printer or a network card, while others are logical objects, like a counter variable, a scheduler queue, or a data structure representing a bank account record in a database. In fact, even the physical resources will be represented and managed by the computer system using some data structure. And, when we have a shared data object, we usually need to associate a lock with it to protect against unwanted interference. So, when we talk about resource deadlocks, we are often talking about the lock that protects that resource from concurrent access. When we say that a thread (or process) has been allocated (equivalently, assigned or granted) a resource, we often mean that the thread has acquired the lock protecting that resource, and is now permitted to use the resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "We often find situations where threads need to acquire multiple resources protected by different locks. For example, consider the problem of transferring funds from one bank account to another. We want the entire transfer to happen atomically---either the funds are in the source account, meaning the transfer hasn't happened yet, or the funds are in the destination account, meaning the transfer has been completed. If we had a single lock for the entire bank database, then all we need to do is acquire that lock, debit the source account and credit the destination account before releasing the lock. But since most operations access a single account (e.g., deposit, withdraw, read balance, etc.), this would give terrible performance to the bank customers. We really want to have a lock associated with each account, so that independent operations on different accounts can happen concurrently. Now the transfer operation needs to acquire locks for both the source and destination accounts and hold them until the balances of both accounts have been updated. Sample code for this setup is shown in {numref}`listing:sync:bugs:transfer`: we have a structure for each account which includes the account balance and a lock, and the transfer function must acquire the locks on both accounts before it updates the balances. As we will see, situations like this can easily lead to deadlocks.\n",

    "### Breaking Mutual Exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we introduced mutual exclusion as one of the requirements for a solution to the critical section problem. Herlihy, however, showed that we can devise *non-blocking* algorithms to operate on concurrent data structures without enforcing mutual exclusion, given atomic hardware instructions such as `compare-and-swap` (`CAS`) {cite}`10.1145/161468.161469` {cite}`10.1145/99163.99185`. These algorithms and data structures are called *lock-free* if they guarantee that *some* thread will complete an operation in a finite number of steps taken by itself or other threads, and *wait-free* if they guarantee that *each* thread will complete an operation in a finite number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind lock-free synchronization is to attempt to make a change optimistically, assuming there will be no interference from other threads. If any interference happens there must be a way to detect and recover from it, usually by retrying the operation. The `CAS(location, expected, new)` atomic instruction (see {numref}`listing:sync:cas`) has this flavor---if the specified memory location still contains the expected value, then there has been no interference, the memory location can be updated with the new value, and the `CAS` succeeds. If the `CAS` fails, then the operation must be retried. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we needed to implement an `AtomicAdd()` function. We saw earlier ({numref}`listing:sync:counter_assembly`) that incrementing or decrementing a variable involves multiple steps, and so we used a lock to make those steps atomic.\n",
    "\n",

    "    *val += a;\n",
    "    pthread_mutex_unlock(&L);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The overhead of acquiring and releasing the lock, however, far exceeds the work of the actual integer addition, making this a very inefficient solution. Using `CAS` we can avoid locking. The solution is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} c\n",
    ":linenos:\n",
    "\n",
    "void AtomicAdd(int *val, int a) \n",

    "    } while (CAS(val, old, new) == false);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread first reads the current value of the variable from the memory location, then adds the requested amount to obtain the new value. The `CAS` will succeed if the value stored in the memory location still matches the old value that was read. If another thread has managed to complete its own `AtomicAdd` on the same location between the read of the old value at line 4 and the `CAS` on line 6, then the memory location will no longer contain the `old` value, the `CAS` will fail (returning `false`) and the thread will return to line 4 for another attempt. We can see that the `AtomicAdd()` is lock-free, because some thread's `CAS` must succeed. It is not wait-free, however, because an unlucky thread could retry an arbitrary number of times without completing its operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `CAS` primitive suffers from what is called the `ABA` problem. Briefly, a `CAS` succeeds when the memory location contains the expected value, however, this does not mean that nothing has changed. It is possible for thread T1 to read a value `A`, thread T2 to change the value to `B`, and thread T3 to change the value back to `A` again before T1 attempts a `CAS`. T1's `CAS` would succeed, even though the execution of other threads had been interleaved with its own accesses to the memory location. In the case of the `AtomicAdd()` shown above, this interleaving is harmless---so long as the current value matches what the thread read previously, the new value will be correct. In implementations of more complex data structures such as a non-blocking stack, however, more care is needed to correctly handle the `ABA` problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "While non-blocking algorithms can prevent deadlocks by eliminating the mutual exclusion requirement, they are complex and hard to design. Efficient non-blocking algorithms exist for a handful of important data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, and linked lists) but there are many situations where they cannot be applied. Consider the bank account `transfer()` function, for example: we can easily update either account using our lock-free `AtomicAdd()`, but this doesn't help us to atomically update *both* accounts. We are often stuck with the mutual exclusion requirement for correctness, so we must look elsewhere for a solution to deadlock.\n",

    "- A thread with 'large' resource needs (e.g., many different locks) may have to wait for a long time for all resources to be available at the same time. Additional effort is needed to ensure these threads do not starve. \n",
    "- The system concurrency is limited because threads must acquire all resources before starting, rather than acquiring them when they needed. Consequently, resources are tied up for a longer time, even when they could be safely used by other threads.\n",
    "- A thread may not know all the resources that it will need before it even starts running. Particularly for interactive tasks, input from the user can heavily influence what resources are needed next. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a general strategy, acquiring all resources before starting execution is not very promising, although it may be used in some specialized systems such as batch processing. Another way to break the hold-and-wait condition requires a thread to release all the resources it already holds before it can request an additional resource. The thread must then submit a batch request for all the resources it needs (the ones it just gave up, and the new resource). The thread will be blocked until the complete set of resources can be allocated to it, but it will not be holding any resources while it waits.  This strategy does not prevent starvation of a thread that needs a large number of resources simultaneously, and it requires care on the part of the programmer to ensure that data structures are not left in an inconsistent state when the resources are released. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of overhead in giving up existing resources (e.g., releasing all the locks already acquired) and then immediately asking for them back again, particularly when the additional resource was already available. To help with this situation, some thread libraries offer a `trylock()` function:\n",
    "- `pthread_mutex_trylock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)`: Acquire the lock referenced by `mutex` if it is available and return 0; if `mutex` is currently locked, the call will return immediately with an error code. \n",
    "\n",
    "A thread holding one or more locks already will first try to acquire an additional lock with a `trylock()` operation. If it succeeds, then there is no need to release the locks it already held. If the `trylock()` fails, however, the thread must release all of the other locks and try again to acquire the full set of locks. For example:\n",

    "By releasing the source account lock on line 5 when the destination account is already locked by another thread, we prevent deadlock from occurring. There is, however, a new possibility of *livelock* in which our two threads performing conflicting transfers, T1 and T2, continually lock one account, find the second account locked by another thread, release their first lock and try again. Inserting some random delay between the release on line 5 and the re-acquisition on line 6 can reduce the likelihood that threads will repeatedly conflict in this way. \n",

    "\n",
    "Breaking the hold-and-wait condition is related to *two-phase locking*, which is a common strategy in database systems. In two-phase locking, an operation that requires multiple locks executes first in a *growing* phase, and then in a *shrinking phase*. In Phase One (growing), the thread tries to acquire all the locks it needs, one at a time. If any lock is unavailable, then it releases all the locks and starts over. Once Phase One succeeds, the thread has all the locks it needs, and can start performing updates, after which it can release the locks. This version of two-phase locking prevents deadlocks by not allowing the hold-and-wait condition. (Note that in the database literature, two-phase locking is often described with hold-and-wait in Phase One. Deadlocks are thus possible, and the database system needs a strategy for detecting them and aborting one of the transactions that is involved in the deadlock cycle.)\n",

    "### Allowing Preemption (breaking the no preemption condition)\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain physical resources, we can prevent deadlock by forcibly preempting the resource from one thread and allocating it to another. In particular, this works for resources that we can *virtualize* so that each thread has the illusion of its own private copy of the resource. For example, a physical CPU can be allocated to one thread for a timeslice, then forcibly preempted and allocated to another thread. Similarly, a page of physical memory can be allocated to the use of one address space, then preempted and reallocated to the use of another address space. In both cases, this is feasible because we can save the state of the resource (in the thread struct for the CPU, or in the swap file for memory) when it is preempted from a thread, and restore the state when it is returned to the thread. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we are dealing with shared data structures, breaking 'no preemption' is not a very appealing option. We don't generally know the state of the data structure if we preempt a lock from a thread in the middle of a critical section, so we have no way of ensuring that the data is consistent before allowing another thread to access it. We also can't guarantee that it is safe for the original thread to resume from the point at which it was preempted, and we have no way of rolling back or aborting the operation that the thread was in the middle of performing. In contrast, database systems include transactional logging mechanisms that make it possible to abort a transaction, preempting the locks that the transaction held and restoring the database to its pre-transaction state.

    "### Breaking Circular Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "The final condition we have to consider is the circular wait. It is quite appealing to allow the first three conditions, since they all serve to make it easier to write correct concurrent code, while ensuring that we never find ourselves in a situation with a circular chain of threads holding some resources and waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "One idea that we can immediately reject is to prevent circular wait by only allowing a thread to request or hold one resource at a time. There are simply too many scenarios where a thread needs to use multiple resources together to accomplish the desired task, such as transferring between two bank accounts. The only feasible way to implement this idea is to have a 'big giant lock' that protects all the resources in the system that could possibly be used together. Then, threads would only need a single resource, namely the big giant lock. In our bank scenario, this would mean a single lock for all the bank accounts, but the resulting loss of concurrency would be unacceptable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is to provide a global ordering of resources, and require all threads to acquire resources according to this ordering. That is, a thread holding resource $j$ cannot make a request for resource $i$ where $i$ < $j$ in the global ordering. The resulting resource allocation graph is guaranteed to contain no cycles, and circular wait is impossible. There are several challenges with this idea in practice. The first is that it may be difficult to come up with a global ordering for a system when there are a large number of different resources. The second is that it relies on programmers to know and respect the global ordering when they write code. Nonetheless, it is a very widely used and effective strategy in practice. \n",

Whichever thread succeeds in locking R2 first will proceed to lock R1 and complete its transfer, releasing both the locks and allowing the other thread to proceed. Deadlock is prevented."

    "### Reality Check\n",
    "\n",
    "No single strategy for dealing with deadlock is appropriate for all resources in all situations. Moreover, all strategies are costly in terms of computation overhead, or restricting the use of resources. Consequently, many systems make some use of what Tanenbaum refers to as \"the ostrich algorithm\": ignore the problem and hope it doesn't happen too often {cite}`10.5555/2655363`. This isn't really as shocking as it might sound at first. For personal computers, which are rebooted frequently, the rare inconvenience of manually resolving a deadlock (by forcibly killing some tasks, or rebooting the machine) is likely to be preferable to the constant overhead of ensuring deadlocks don't occur. On the other hand, deadlocks are unacceptable in safety critical systems and ensuring they don't occur is worth some loss in performance. Modern operating systems like Linux employ a mix of strategies for deadlock, including using lock-free algorithms when possible, defining a well-documented lock hierarchy that kernel programmers are expected to follow, and providing runtime lock validators that check for deadlocks or incorrect lock usage. Because of the high runtime cost, such validators are generally used during development but not in deployment.  "

    "## Livelock, Starvation and Other Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "While atomicity violations, order violations, and deadlocks collectively made up over 98% of the concurrency bugs in Lu et al.'s study {cite}`10.1145/1346281.1346323`, there are other subtle concurrency issues that can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In {numref}`cont:sync:concurrency_bugs:deadlock:holdandwait`, we briefly mentioned *livelock*, which occurs when threads are running and changing state, but are not making progress towards completing an operation.  The common example of a real-world livelock is when two people meet in a narrow corridor and each repeatedly steps aside in the same direction to let the other person pass.  The `trylock` scenario is one way that livelock can occur in a computer system. More generally, livelocks can happen whenever threads continually retry a failed operation. For example, there is usually some limit on the number of files that a process can have open. Suppose this limit is set to 10 and we have a multithreaded process with 16 threads, each of which needs to open 2 files (say, to read its input and write its output). If a thread's attempt to open a file fails because there are too many open files already (e.g., `open()` returns -1 with `errno == EMFILE` \"Too many open files\"), then the thread will simply try to open the file again, in the hopes that some other thread will finish, close its files, and allow this thread to proceed. Code for this is depicted in {numref}`listing:sync:bugs:livelock-files`. Now, if all available open files are used by threads that have opened their input files, no thread will be able to open an output file and complete its work. This scenario looks extremely similar to deadlock: we have a limited set of resources (slots in the open file table), all of the resources have been allocated to threads, and all of the threads are holding their resources while waiting for an additional resource that is held by another thread. The difference is that the threads are not blocked---they are repeatedly issuing an `open()` system call and getting a response, so work is being done, but the threads are not making any progress. \n",

This may be because of the difficulty in diagnosing and reproducing livelocks, or because programmers were aware of the potential for livelock and took care to avoid it (for example, by setting a limit on the number of retries).

    "**Starvation** is distinct from deadlock and livelock, although, again, some thread (or threads) never receive the resources they need. The difference is that the resource(s) a thread is waiting for will repeatedly become free, but is always allocated to a different thread. We saw this in shortest-job-first scheduling, where an infinite sequence of short threads are always granted the CPU ahead of a long-running thread. Starvation may also occur if a thread has to give up all the resources (locks) it already holds before it is allowed to request more resources. Starvation related to synchronization can also occur with reader/writer locks, where threads that only need to read a data object can execute concurrently using a shared lock but threads that need to write the data object must obtain an exclusive lock, waiting for all readers to finish. Finally, starvation can occur due to characteristics of modern hardware that give some threads an advantage when competing for a lock, such as NUMA memory systems and caching."
