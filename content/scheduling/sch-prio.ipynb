    "The core idea behind priority scheduling is that some processes may be more important than others and should be given access to the CPU first.   For example, one reasonable assumption might be that tasks of students should only run if there are no tasks from professors.  To implement this policy, the OS maintains two or more priority queues which hold tasks assigned to the corresponding priority. Runnable processes in a lower priority queue are only run if there are none in a higher priority queues.  Figure {numref}`priority-sched` shows a simple example of a system with 5 priority queues. In this snapshot, the next process to be given CPU time will be the first process in the priority 5 queue. Assuming no additions, the processes in queue 3 will not run until all of the ones in 5 have completed.\n",

    "A runs by itself until B becomes ready to run.  We then preempt A after it has accumulated one second of run time, and context switch to B since it is higher priority.  When C starts running, it is the same priority as B, so they share the CPU (i.e., we switch back and forth between them every quantum). At time 3, D enters with the highest priority, and we stop running B and C to just run it.  At that point, B has accumulated 1.5 sec of runtime, and C has accumulated .5 seconds.  Once D is done, we again share the CPU using round robin between B and C, until B has accumulated its full 2 seconds of runtime, after which we can use the CPU just for running C.  Finally, at second 6, all the other tasks are done and A, the lowest priority task, can be run until it completes.  The average turnaround time here is $((4-3) + (5-1) + (6-2) + 11)/4 = 5$ seconds. \n",

    "While round robin does a better job than run to completion it doesn't do a good job for I/O bound tasks.  If there are many CPU intensive tasks.  Consider the case of 100 CPU intensive tasks that each consume their full quantum of, say, 10msec. If the I/O intensive task only runs for a few usec, and then does some quick I/O, it might have to wait for $10msec * 100 = 1 sec$ before it gets to run again.  What we really want to do is to prioritize I/O intensive tasks.   Unfortunately, we don't know which tasks are CPU or I/O intensive a-priori, and further a task may go back and forth between being CPU and I/O intensive. \n",
