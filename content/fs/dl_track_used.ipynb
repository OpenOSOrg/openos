    "The main job of the file system is to use the blocks on the disk to store persistent data for users in files, and to support the organization of those files into directories. Clearly, we will need a way for the file system to keep track of which blocks are being used for each file. In this Chapter, we will explore several options for this important design decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in many (most? all?) file systems, directory objects (which hold file system metadata about the files in that directory) are stored exactly like files. Part of the information the file system keeps about each object is a type field, which allows the file system to distinguish file objects from directory objects. While the content of file objects is only understood by the applications that use them (above the file system), the content of directory objects is understood and managed by the file system itself. Everything we say here about techniques for keeping track of the blocks used by files also applies to the task of tracking blocks used by directories."

    "The simplest organization of a file system is to just have each file or directory occupy a contiguous set of blocks on the disk.  For example, {numref}`fs:cd-rom` shows a structure similar to early versions of the ISO-9660 file system for CD-ROM disks. Objects on disk are either files or\n",

    "pointers in the file system are in terms of *block numbers*, with blocks\n",
    "numbered from block 0 at the beginning of the disk or partition. Note that the `len` field in {numref}`fs:cd-rom` gives the file length in *bytes*, not blocks, but space in the file system must be allocated in block-sized chunks. The number of blocks used by the file can be calculated as the ceiling of the file size divided by the block size, i.e., $\\lceil len / 2048 \\rceil$ in this example.\n",

This approach doesn't have the external fragmentation challenge of contiguous files, because any available block can be used to add more data to any file by simply adding the block to the list.\n",

    "The top part of {numref}`fig:filesys:linked` uses internal pointers in a block, where each block stores slightly less than a full block of data to make room for the pointer metadata.  This approach might seem attractive, however, it is not practical for several reasons. First, to read the block containing data at a particular offset in a file, one has to read blocks sequentially through the entire linked list up to the required block. Second, mixing file data with file system metadata in the same block would add complexity to operating system features like memory-mapped files. We won't be in a position to explain why this is the case until we cover memory management, however. Finally, because the amount of data stored in a block is no longer a power of 2, calculating the block that contains a given offset will require integer division operations, rather than cheaper right-shift operations.  \n",
