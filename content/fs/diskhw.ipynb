However, most file systems have been designed to work on **hard disk drives**, and understanding a bit about them is important to understand how file systems work.  Hard drives records data magnetically on one or more spinning platters in concentric circular tracks ({numref}`fig:cylinders`).\n",

    "2. Performing a **seek** that moves the head assembly until the head is positioned over the target track; the time spent to do this is called the **seek time**\n",

    "The seek and rotational latency have a major effect on disk performance. To give an example, consider randomly accessing 4 KB data blocks on a 7200 RPM (i.e., a disk that rotates at 7200 times per minute).   The average rotational latency would be $4 ms$, i.e., 1/2 the time for a 7200 RPM drive to rotate.  A typical transfer rate might be around 200 MB/s, so to transfer a 4 KB block it would take $(4/1000)/200 = 0.02 sec$.  A common seek time for a drive might be around $8ms$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a file system that resulted in random reads (or writes) across the whole disk, would end up taking $8 + 4 + 0.02 = 12 ms$ for each block, or having an average throughput of 333 KB/s (i.e., $4/(12/1000)$ ).  If you use the minimum sector size of many disks, at 512 B, you would get only around 41 KB per second, while if you used a 16 KB block, your throughput would go up to around 1.3 MB per second. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the file system always transferred a $5$MB block, it would require $8 + 4 + 25 = 37 ms$ for an average throughput of $134$ MB/s. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when designing a file system,  for performance you want to read relatively big disks blocks, 2) you want to have data frequently accessed together on the same tracks/cylinder, since seeking to nearby tracks is much faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most files are 4KB, and most of the storage space is used by small number of very big files.  "
