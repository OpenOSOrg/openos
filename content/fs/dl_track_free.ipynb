    "If you recall the approach used in [FAT file system](fs:dl_track_used:ll) to represent used blocks, the same data structure was also used to represent used blocks.  When allocating a block the file system needed to search through the linked list until it found an entry marked as free; an extreemly inefficient approach.\n",

    "The original Unix file system used a free list to store a list of unused blocks (see {numref}`fs:fs:free:ll`);  blocks were allocated from the head of this list for new files, and returned to the head when freed. Implementing this results in a large initialization cost; if you have a 1TB drive, it means you will start off by having 4M 4KB blocks to hold the free list to start off with, however, it compresses to a small number of blocks for the free list when the disk becomes full.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The bigger disadvantage of this approach is that, as files were created and deleted this list became randomized, so that blocks allocated for a file are rarely sequential and disk seeks were needed for nearly every block read from or written to disk. Originally this wasn't a significant problem, because early Unix systems ran on machines with fast disks and excruciatingly slow CPUs.  \n",

    "greatly improving performance. Note, when disk is fragmented, each block may have just a few bits available, so this approach becomes expensive to find a block.  However, since a single page of 4096 bytes can represent 132MB ($4096*8*4096), you can efficiently cache these blocks in memory. "
