    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From a hardware perspective, the simplest memory management model is to have processes just use the physical address space; where instructions executed on the processor directly reference physical memory addresses.  For example, if the application wants to load a register, from location ``0x1234`` it would get the data stored at physical memory location ``0x1234``.   For example, the original Microsoft DOS operating system, supported exactly this model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in {numref}`mem-pys-mem-fig`, the operating system needs to be loaded into one part of the memory, and each program that you would want to run needs to be loaded into different physical memory at different addresses. \n",

    "There are two major problems with physical memory management.  First, there is no protection between the different programs.  A bug in program 1 may cause program 2 to be modified, or even modify the operating system. \n",

    "Second, programs need to be re-located when they are loaded.  If we are going to run multiple programs, we can't know a-priori the location where the program will be loaded.  However, when the program is compiled and linked into object code specific addresses, for example for branches needed to be specified in the program.  \n",

    "## Segmentation(AKA base and bounds translation).\n",
    "In the simplest form of segmentation the hardware provides 2 registers that are loaded each time a process acquire the CPU, a base register and a limit register.  For a given process the base register contains the physical address that the program was loaded at and the limit register contains the size of the program that was loaded into memory.  Every process has a virtual address space starting at zero and a size determined by the actual program size that the process is running.  The process specific base and limit registers which are loaded every time a process acquires the CPU establishes the bounds of the virtual address space for every process.  For each and every memory reference the hardware adds the virtual address to the base register to determine a physical address and insures that the physical address is between the base register and base register plus the limit register.  If it is outside those bounds the program is terminated with an illegal virtual memory reference error.  Segmentation solves both the lack of protection and the mandatory relocation requirements of physical addressing.  Segmentation has little or no performance overhead because the hardware performs the virtual to physical translation or the addition of the virtual address and the base register to determine every physical address.\n",

    "### Single segments per address space\n",
    "So far we discussed a segmentation implementation that provides one base register and one limit register in hardware and one of each of those process specific values that gets loaded into those registers when context switching to a given process.  Since there is only one of each register, the entire process virtual address space must be physically contiguous and all text, data and stack must be within that single memory region.  While this is a huge improvement over a physical memory model it limits the size of the virtual address space to being static and not expandable.  There is no way to dynamically increase the size of the text, data or stack regions of a process at run-time, everything must be allocated in advance.  This requires allocating physical memory that might never be used.\n",

    "### Multiple segments per address space.\n",
    "As mentioned earlier a single base and limit segment register implies that an entire process virtual address space is a one physically contiguous region of physical memory mapped into one virtually contiguous virtual region of virtual memory.  This means that the text, data and stack regions must be packed tightly together in both physical and virtual memory unless we are willing to waste both physical and virtual memory.  Also, with only one segment register its not possible to offer different types of protections for the various regions of the virtual address space.  In other words all of virtual memory must be readable, writable and executable since data must be both readable and writable and text must be executable.  It would be nice to prevent data regions from being executable and text regions from being readable and writable for security and debug optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by the hardware implementing multiple segment and limit registers with only specified permissions for text, data and stack regions and having the operating system use those registers when context switching to a process.  When mapping the text into a virtual region the operating system can specify an execute only region that does not have to be adjacent to other non-executable regions.  When mapping data into virtual memory the operating system can specify read/write only thereby preventing execution of data regions.  Finally the stack can also be non-executable but also the operating system can move the virtual memory stack region away from any other region making it easier to debug common programming problems like stack overflows.  Finally multiple segment registers eliminates the necessity for the text, data and stack regions to be physically contiguous.  This allows a program to be split up into multiple smaller regions both physically and virtually making it much easier to hold more programs in physical memory at the same time.\n",

    "### Private versus Global segments.\n",
    "Every process virtual address space consists of 2 types of regions, Private and Global.  The private regions for a process are the program specific text, data and stack regions that the process is running.  The global regions include the operating system that is and must be mapped into every process address space.  As we discussed earlier in this course the operating system consists of all the software that executes on behalf of the currently running program as well as basic system overhead that runs on behalf of the system.  This includes all the system calls the operating system supports.  Since every process must map the operating system kernel it is shared between every running process rather than each process containing a separate copy.  The global segment registers are used to map the shared kernel text, data and kernel stack area in every process and at the same virtual addresses.  When a context switch occurs only the private segments registers are changed for the newly running process, there is no need to change the global segment registers since they are identical for every process.\n",

    "When a new process is created and a program runs the kernel reads the program text, data and stack memory into the available or free physical memory locations.  From there the private segment registers are use to map that physical memory into the private virtual address space of the process, allowing the process to run the program.  When a process exits, the physical memory regions that the process consumed is made available or freed onto a physical memory free list.  Over time as processes are created, run and exit the physical memory becomes more and more fragmented.  After a while as processes come and go its likely that the sum of available physical memory is large enough to satisfy a request but there is no physically contiguous free memory region large enough to hold the request."

    "Segmentation, especially with multiple segment registers along with private and global segment registers provides a huge benefit over a physical memory management model.  We can now support many processes running at the same time with protection between processes and even protection within a process.  However Segmentation still has major weaknesses, 1.) the memory for a segment must be physically contiguous, 2.) the virtual address size can never exceed the physical address size with segmentation.  Needing physically contiguous memory is a huge problem, it requires compaction and swapping in order to run a significant number of processes simultaneously.  Limiting programs to less that the amount of physical memory on a given system is also very limiting.  It would be very convenient to be able to allocate a very large sparse region of virtual memory and only actually use a small subset of it.  Imagine allocating an array of fixed size records for every possible student at Boston University and indexing that array by the student's social security number.  There are 10^9 or 1 Billion social security numbers but only a few thousand students at BU.  Such a large sparse array could not be implemented with segmentation unless the system actually had all the necessary physical memory for every possible social security number.  Imagine being able to map millions of files in a virtual address space on a system that didn't have all that much physical memory."
