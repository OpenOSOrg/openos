    "## Paged Address Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Most systems today use paged address translation or paging.  A paged virtual memory system divides both virtual memory and physical memory into fixed size chunks or pieces.  They are known as virtual pages or just pages in the virtual address space and page frames in physical memory.  Each page of virtual memory that is being used maps to a page frame.\n",

    "Paged virtual memory example\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of paging over segmentation is that the virtual address space can be much larger than physical memory.  In the segmentation memory model its not possible to run a program that's requires more memory than the system has.  This means a program may run on a system with a large amount of memory and not be able to run on a system with a smaller amount of memory.  On a paged memory system every process has exactly the same size virtual address space typically gigabytes, terabytes or even petabytes on modern systems but only uses a small portion in most cases.  The physical memory is typically much smaller than a single virtual address space, megabytes or gigabytes, and there can be hundreds or even thousands of processes running on a system.  As a process runs on a paged memory system only the virtual pages needed at any moment are required to be in physical memory which is a small subset of the entire amount of physical memory.  The memory management system takes care of insuring that the necessary virtual to physical mappings are in place.  A large program running on a small memory system just runs slower rather than not at all on a paged memory system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of paging over segmentation is that a region of virtual memory or memory segment does not need to map physically contiguous memory.  Since the virtual address space is divided into small fixed size pages a virtually contiguous region of memory can map to page frames that are randomly scattered throughout the entire physical memory.  This completely eliminates external fragmentation and therefore the need to perform compaction.  The only fragmentation issue encountered in a page virtual memory system is internal fragmentation of the unused portion of a page at the end of a region of virtual memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MMU Memory Management Unit\n",
    "\n",
    "On paged systems the CPU includes special hardware that maintains the virtual to physical page mappings known as the MMU or Memory Management Unit.  Every time a virtual address is referenced the MMU translates that virtual address to a physical address before presenting it to the memory address bus hardware.  \n",

    "bounds registers, it requires much more information. Base and bounds\n",
    "translation only requires two values, which can easily be held in\n",
