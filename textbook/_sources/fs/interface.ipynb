    "There are several common types of file operations supported by Linux\n",
    "(and with slight differences, Windows). They can be classified into\n",
    "three main categories: open/close, read/write, and naming and\n",
    "directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open/close\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to access a file in Linux (or most operating\n",
    "systems) you first need to open the file, passing the file name and\n",
    "other parameters and receiving a *handle* (called a *file descriptor* in\n",
    "Unix) which may be used for further operations. The corresponding system\n",
    "calls are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int desc = open(name, O_READ)`: Verify that file `name` exists and may\n",
    "be read, and then return a *descriptor* which may be used to refer to\n",
    "that file when reading it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int desc = open(name, O_WRITE | flags, mode)`: Verify permissions and\n",
    "open `name` for writing, creating it (or erasing existing contents) if\n",
    "necessary as specified in `flags`. Returns a descriptor which may be\n",
    "used for writing to that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `close(desc)`: stop using this descriptor, and free any resources\n",
    "allocated for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that application programs rarely use the system calls themselves to\n",
    "access files, but instead use higher-level frameworks, ranging from Unix\n",
    "Standard I/O to high-level application frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read/Write operations\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a file with data in it, you need to\n",
    "write it; to use that data you need to read it. To allow reading and\n",
    "writing in units of less than an entire file, or tedius calculations of\n",
    "the current file offset, UNIX uses the concept of a *current position*\n",
    "associated with a file descriptor. When you read 100 bytes (i.e. bytes 0\n",
    "to 99) from a file this pointer advances by 100 bytes, so that the next\n",
    "read will start at byte 100, and similarly for write. When a file is\n",
    "opened for reading the pointer starts at 0; when open for writing the\n",
    "application writer can choose to start at the beginning (default) and\n",
    "overwrite old data, or start at the end (`O_APPEND` flag) to append new\n",
    "data to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "System calls for reading and writing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n = read(desc, buffer, max)`: Read `max` bytes (or fewer if the end of\n",
    "the file is reached) into `buffer`, starting at the current position,\n",
    "and returning the actual number of bytes `n` read; the current position\n",
    "is then incremented by `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n = write(desc, buffer, len)`: Write `len` bytes from `buffer` into\n",
    "the file, starting at the current position, and incrementing the current\n",
    "position by `len`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lseek(desc, offset, flag)`: Set an open file's current position to that\n",
    "specified by `offset` and `flag`, which specifies whether `offset` is\n",
    "relative to the beginning, end, or current position in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^3]: On Linux the `pread` and `pwrite` system calls allow specifying an\n",
    "    offset for the read or write; other UNIX-derived operating systems\n",
    "    have their own extensions for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the basic Unix interface (unlike e.g. Windows) there is no\n",
    "way to specify a particular location in a file to read or write\n",
    "from[^3]. Programs like databases (e.g. SQLite, MySQL) which need to\n",
    "write to and read from arbitrary file locations must instead move the\n",
    "current position by using `lseek` before a read or write. However most\n",
    "programs either read or write a file from the beginning to the end\n",
    "(especially when written for an OS that makes it easier to do things\n",
    "that way), and thus don't really need to perform seeks. Because most\n",
    "Unix programs use simple \"stream\" input and output, these may be\n",
    "re-directed so that the same program can---without any special\n",
    "programming---read from or write to a terminal, a network connection, a\n",
    "file, or a pipe from or to another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^4]: A hard link is an additional directory entry pointing to the same\n",
    "    file, giving the file two (or more) names. Hard links are peculiar\n",
    "    to Unix, and in modern systems have mostly been replaced with\n",
    "    symbolic links (covered next); however Apple's Time Machine makes\n",
    "    very good use of them: multiple backups can point to the same single\n",
    "    copy of an un-modified file using hard links.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^5]: Sort of. If there are multiple hard links to a file, then this\n",
    "    just removes one of them; the file isn't deleted until the last link\n",
    "    is removed. Even then it might not be removed yet - on Unix, if you\n",
    "    delete an open file it won't actually be removed until all open file\n",
    "    handles are closed.. In general, deleting open files is a problem:\n",
    "    while Unix solves the problem by deferring the actual delete,\n",
    "    Windows solves it by protecting open files so that they cannot be\n",
    "    deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming and Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix there is a difference between a name\n",
    "(a directory entry) and the object (file or directory) that the name\n",
    "points to. The naming and directories operations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rename(path1, path2)` - Rename an object (i.e. file or directory) by\n",
    "either changing the name in its directory entry (if the destination is\n",
    "in the same directory) or creating a new entry and deleting the old one\n",
    "(if moving into a new directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `link(path1, path2)`: Add a *hard link* to a file[^4].\n",
    "\n",
    "- `unlink(path)`: Delete a file.[^5]\n",
    "\n",
    "- `desc = opendir(path)`, `readdir(desc, dirent*), dirent=(name,type,length)`: This interface\n",
    "allows a program to enumerate names in a directory, and determine their\n",
    "type. (i.e. file, directory, symbolic link, or special-purpose file)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stat(file, statbuf)`\n",
    "`fstat(desc, statbuf)`:  returns file attributes - size, owner,\n",
    "permissions, modification time, etc. In Unix these are attributes of the\n",
    "file itself, residing in the i-node, and can't be found in the directory\n",
    "entry - otherwise it would be necessary to keep multiple copies\n",
    "consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mkdir(path)`\n",
    "`rmdir(path)`: directory operations: create a new, empty directory, or\n",
    "delete an empty directory.\n"
