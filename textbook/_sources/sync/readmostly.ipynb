For example, the OS caches network routing information, but route updates are infrequent compared to route lookups in the cache. Since read-only accesses cannot conflict with each other, we would like to allow \"readers\" to execute concurrently with each other (sharing access to the data structure), while \"writers\" must not be allowed to conflict with either readers or other writers.

    "The writer code (lines 11-13) is very simple. We introduce a `mutex` semaphore (line 4) to protect access to the shared database. The `wait` on `mutex` at line 10 ensures that only one writer can be accessing the database at any time; when the writer is done, it `post`s a notice to `mutex` that the database is now available again (line 12). The reader code needs to do a little more work, however, because we want to allow multiple readers. First, we want to keep track of the number of readers currently accessing the database, so we introduce a `reader_count` variable (line 6), and since this variable will be updated by every reader thread, we also add a `counter_mutex` semaphore (line 5) to protect sections of code that depend on the `reader_count`. Each reader thread begins by `wait`ing for the `counter_mutex`, then increments `reader_count` to add itself to the count of current readers (lines 18-19). Only the first reader thread needs to synchronize with writer threads (lines 20-23)---once a reader has successfully `wait`ed for the `mutex`, writers will be locked out until all the readers are done. Notice also that the first reader does not `post` to the `counter_mutex` until *after* it has obtained permission to access the database (line 24). This ensures that other reader threads must line up `wait`ing for the `counter_mutex` as long as a writer is accessing the database; once the first reader obtains access to the database, the other readers only need to increment the `reader_count`. When a reader finishes using the database, it must again `wait` for the `counter_mutex` to subtract itself from the count of current readers (lines 28-29). When the `reader_count` falls to zero, it means that the last reader thread is done using the database, and this last thread must `post` a signal to the `mutex` to indicate that the database is available again (lines 30-33). If any writers are waiting, one will now be allowed to proceed; otherwise the database remains available until either a reader or writer threads requests access.\n",

    "## Read-Copy Update\n",
    "\n",
    "*Read-Copy Update* (RCU) is an alternative reader/writer synchronization mechanism designed for read-mostly data structures. Readers use no locks at all, thereby addressing the read-side overhead of rwlocks. Writers only need to synchronize with other writers, typically by using ordinary locks. Thus, RCU lets multiple readers access data concurrently with one writer. The key property we need to ensure is that readers always see a consistent version of the data, either before a writer performs an update, or after the update is complete. To achieve this, writers must create new versions of the data atomically, for example, by making a copy of a node in a data structure that they want to update, performing the update on the copy, and atomically replacing the old copy with the new copy into the data structure. Concurrent readers can continue to access the old version of the data; new readers will see the update. Of course, the old version must be deleted at some point, but only after we are able to guarantee that no reader can be accessing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike with reader/writer locks, RCU readers can read stale data and may see inconsistencies (for example, an RCU reader counting the number of items in a linked list might return a total that would not be possible under reader/writer locking). However, there are many situations where this staleness and inconsistency doesn't matter. Paul McKenney uses the example of the network routing table in one of his [RCU LWN article](https://lwn.net/Articles/263130/):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Because routing updates can take considerable time to reach a given system (seconds or even minutes), the system will have been sending packets the wrong way for quite some time when the update arrives. It is usually not a problem to continue sending updates the wrong way for a few additional milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although RCU readers use no locking, we still need to reason about reader accesses to shared data, to determine when it is safe for a writer to reclaim memory. Thus, we refer to the sections of code where readers are accessing a shared data structure as a *read-side critical section*, and we impose some restrictions on what threads are allowed to do in a read-side critical section. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will present RCU with reference to the Linux kernel implementation. An excellent resource for further reading on this topic can be found in the [Linux kernel documentation of RCU]`https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html`. "

    "### Why RCU?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into RCU and how it works in more detail, we will motivate the RCU approach using the example of a concurrent hash table, as depicted in {numref}`fig:sync:readmostly:rcu:hashtable`. Such data structures are widely used in operating systems, for example to build caches of network routing information or file system metadata, and to locate data structures like the thread structure given a key like the thread identifier. To look up a key in the hashtable, a hash function selects a bucket (i.e., an entry in an array). Collisions are handled by chaining, so once we have found the right bucket, we will need to search the linked list of items that hash to the same bucket. Since the hashtable can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently searching for items, inserting new items, or deleting items, we will need some synchronization. Rather than a single lock on the entire hashtable, we can increase concurrency by using a separate lock for each bucket in the hashtable. Because each bucket has its own lock, we can simplify the scenario by just thinking about concurrent operations on a linked list; operations that hash to different buckets will not conflict with each other.  \n",

At some point after T1 has a pointer to N, a writer thread T2 deletes N from the linked list. Removal from the list can be done atomically by changing the previous node's `next` field to point to the node that follows N (shown by the dotted line in the figure).

Each node includes an integer reference count, and each thread must atomically increment the reference count when it gets a pointer to the node, and atomically decrement the reference count when it is done with the node. A node that is removed from the linked list can be reclaimed when the removing thread holds the last reference to it. Thus, as T1 traverses the list, it must perform two atomic operations on *every* node that it visits just to guarantee that the node doesn't disappear out from under it (see {numref}`fig:sync:readmostly:rcu:linkedlist_nbs_refcount`). Worse, all reader threads need to atomically change the reference counts, even if there aren't any writers operating concurrently!\n",

    "### The read-side\n",
    "\n",
    "The Linux RCU API requires programmers to mark the boundaries of a read-side critical section with `rcu_read_lock()` and `rcu_read_unlock()` calls. Reader threads are not allowed to block in an RCU read-side critical section, and are not allowed to use any pointer to rcu-protected shared data outside of a read-side critical section. In spite of the names, these API calls do not actually lock anything. In a non-preemptible kernel build environment, they are simply empty macros that do nothing at all. For a pre-emptible kernel, the `rcu_read_lock()` call simply needs to disable preemption, while the `rcu_read_unlock()` call re-enables it. This ensures that readers can complete their critical sections without losing the CPU to any interfering threads. Even in a non-preemptible kernel, marking the boundaries of read-side critical sections with an API call is useful, as it helps programmers to reason about their code and avoid violating the requirements of read-side critical sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The write-side\n",
    "\n",
    "RCU writers can use any mechanism to synchronize with other writers, but typically an ordinary mutual exclusion lock is used, because updates are expected to be relatively infrequent and so contention on the writer lock is expected to be low. Writers carry out their updates in two phases:\n",
    "1. The *removal phase* may atomically remove items from a data structure. These removals may occur due to either updates or deletions from the data structure. In the case of an update, the removed item is replaced with a reference to a new version of the item. Note that the removal phase may also insert completely new items to the data structure, without removing anything, in which case the second phase is not needed.\n",
    "2. The *reclamation phase* frees the memory used by the removed items. \n",
    "\n",
    "The removal phase runs concurrently with readers, so readers that are active in a read-side critical section during this phase might still be using the removed items. To avoid use-after-free bugs in the readers, a writer must wait for a *grace period* between the removal and reclamation phases, after which there is a guarantee that all readers that were active during the removal phase no longer hold references to these items. Any readers that start after the removal phase can't possibly obtain a reference to the removed items, so we don't need to consider them. We show an example of this split update approach in {numref}`fig:sync:readmostly:rcu:splitupdate`. Readers that are still active in their read-side critical section at the end of the removal phase are depicted with cross-hatches. The writer must wait until all of these pre-existing readers have left their read-side critical sections and can no longer make any references to the removed data. After this grace period, the writer can reclaim the memory allocated for the removed item. Readers that enter their read-side critical section during the grace period, or during the reclamation phase, do not need to be waited for. \n",

In this function, we first allocate memory for a new copy of the structure (line 16, `kmalloc` is just the kernel version of the C library `malloc` function), then (under the protection of the writer lock) we make a copy of the current structure, update the `a` field, and make the new version of the structure visible to other threads by setting the global `shared_foo` pointer to the new copy (lines 17-21). At this point, the removal phase of the update is complete and we can release the writer lock (line 22). The writer must wait for a grace period before it can free the memory allocated to the old copy of the structure, which it does by calling the Linux `synchronize_rcu()` function (line 25).

It assumes that instructions cannot be re-ordered by either the compiler or the CPU at runtime; the full Linux RCU API includes operations to enforce the required ordering when reading or writing rcu-protected pointers. Now, let's look at what happens in the `synchronize_rcu()` function to ensure there are no dangerous read-reclaim races. "

    "### Handling read-reclaim races\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in handling read-reclaim races lies in detecting when a grace period has elapsed. We cannot use actual time to define a grace period, since we do not know how long readers will stay in a read-side critical section. We also don't want the readers to do any extra work to help detect grace periods, as happens with reference counting, or at least keep the reader overhead to a bare minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "RCU uses *quiescent state based reclamation* (QSBR) {cite}`10.1016/j.jpdc.2007.04.010` to detect grace periods and determine when it is safe to reclaim a removed item. We define a *quiescent state* for a thread T as a state in which T holds no references to rcu-protected shared data. We can then define a *grace period* as an interval in which every thread has entered at least one quiescent state, as shown in {numref}`fig:sync:readmostly:rcu:qsbr`. Essentially, this means that we do not need to be concerned with tracking *every* reference to shared data from *every* thread---we just need to track quiescent states. \n",

    "Illustration of quiescent state based reclamation. Grace periods occur when every thread has gone through a quiescent state. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can we know that a thread is in a quiescent state if we are not keeping track of its references to shared data? Recall that reader threads are not allowed to use any pointer to rcu-protected data outside of a read-side critical section. So, whenever a reader thread is not in a read-side critical section, it is in a quiescent state. Recall also that readers in a read-side critical section cannot block or be preempted. These properties are a great help in detecting grace periods in an operating system kernel. First, any thread that is not running on a CPU at the end of a writer's removal phase must already be in a quiescent state and we don't need to consider them any further. Second, for all threads that are running on a CPU at the end of the writer's removal phase, they must be in a quiescent state when a context switch occurs (i.e., context switches, whether due to blocking or preemption, are not allowed in a read-side critical section). Thus, the `synchronize_rcu()` function only needs to wait until all other CPUs perform a context switch to be sure that a grace period has elapsed. Conceptually, this can be done by having the writer thread run some code in the `synchronize_rcu()` function on every CPU. If the writer is able to run on every CPU, then a context switch must have occurred on every CPU, and every reader thread has entered at least one quiescent state. A sketch of the code for this \"toy\" implementation is shown in {numref}`listing:sync:readmostly:synchronize_rcu`. \n",
